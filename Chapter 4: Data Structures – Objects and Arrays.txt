Chapter 4: Data Structures – Objects and Arrays

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Arrays: Storing Sequences
    Arrays provide a specialized data type for storing sequences of values.
    • Indexing: JavaScript uses zero-based counting. The first element is at index 0, and the last is at array.length - 1.
    • Gotcha: typeof []: Evaluating typeof [] produces "object", as arrays are specialized objects for storing sequences.
    • Basic Methods:
        ◦ push(value): Adds an element to the end of the array.
        ◦ pop(): Removes and returns the last element.
        ◦ unshift(value): Adds an element to the front.
        ◦ shift(): Removes and returns the first element.
2. Properties and Methods
    Almost all JavaScript values have properties, with the critical exceptions of null and undefined.
    • Dot vs. Bracket Notation:
        ◦ value.x fetches the property literally named "x".
        ◦ value[x] evaluates the expression x and uses the result (converted to a string) as the property name.
    • Gotcha: Accessing null/undefined: Attempting to access a property on null or undefined (e.g., null.length) will throw a TypeError.
    • Methods: Properties that contain function values are called methods. For example, toUpperCase() is a method of a string.
3. Objects: Arbitrary Collections
    Objects are collections of properties, created using braces {}.
    • Syntax & Shorthand: If a property name in an object literal is not followed by a value, its value is taken from a binding with the same name.
    • Operations:
        ◦ delete object.property: Removes a property "tentacle" from an object.
        ◦ in: A binary operator that returns true if an object has a property with a specific name.
        ◦ Object.keys(object): Returns an array of strings representing the object’s property names.
        ◦ Object.assign(target, source): Copies all properties from one object into another.
4. Mutability and Identity
    Understanding the difference between immutable values (numbers, strings, Booleans) and mutable objects is vital for JS developers.
    • Identity Gotcha: Comparing objects with == (or ===) checks for identity, not content. Two different objects with the same properties are not equal.
    • const with Objects: A const binding to an object prevents the binding itself from being changed, but the contents (properties) of the object can still be modified.
5. Advanced Syntax: Rest, Spread, and Destructuring
    • Rest Parameters: Using ... in a function’s last parameter collects all remaining arguments into an array.
    • Spread Syntax: Using ... in a function call "spreads" an array into separate arguments. In object literals, it adds all properties from another object.
    • Destructuring: A succinct way to "look inside" an array or object to bind its internal values.
        ◦ Gotcha: Attempting to destructure null or undefined results in an error.
6. Modern Features: Optional Chaining
    • ?. Operator: Allows reading properties when you aren't sure if the value is an object. If the value before ?. is null or undefined, the expression returns undefined instead of crashing.
7. JSON: Data Serialization
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a format for serializing data for storage or network transmission.
    • Restrictions: All property names must be in double quotes. Only simple data expressions (no function calls or bindings) and no comments are allowed.
    • Methods: JSON.stringify converts a value to a string; JSON.parse converts a string back into a value.
8. The Math Object
    The Math object acts as a namespace for number-related utilities to avoid polluting the global scope.
    • Math.random(): Returns a pseudorandom number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
    • Math.floor(): Rounds down to the nearest whole number.
    • Math.ceil(): Rounds up to a whole number.

Analogy for Objects: Think of an object as an octopus with many tentacles. Each tentacle has a name (property) and grasps a value. You can cut a tentacle off with delete or grow a new one by assigning a value to a new name.
